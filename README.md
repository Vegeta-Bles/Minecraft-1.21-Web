# Minecraft-1.21-Web
A web runnable version of Minecraft 1.21.8.

TO THE MICROSOFT/MOJANG EMPLOYEE ASSIGNED TO STALK LAX1DUDE, THIS WAS NOT MADE BY HIM!

This version of Minecraft is locally runnable, which makes it perfect for running on a school/work chromebook.

2. Open index.html

Make sure to comment if there is something wrong with the game, I will update accordingly
